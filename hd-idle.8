.SH NAME
hd-idle \- spin down idle hard disks
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hd-idle
.RI [ options ]
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
hd-idle is a utility program for spinning down external disks after a period
of idle time. Since most external IDE disk enclosures don't support setting
the IDE idle timer, a program like hd-idle is required to spin down idle
disks automatically.
.P
A word of caution: hard disks don't like spinning up too often. Laptop disks
are more robust in this respect than desktop disks but if you set your disks
to spin down after a few seconds you may damage the disk over time due to the
stress the spin-up causes on the spindle motor and bearings. It seems that
manufacturers recommend a minimum idle time of 3-5 minutes, the default in
hd-idle is 10 minutes.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a name
Set device name of disks for subsequent idle-time parameters
.B (-i).
This parameter is optional in the sense that there's a default entry for
all disks which are not named otherwise by using this parameter. This can
also be a symlink (e.g. /dev/disk/by-uuid/...)
.TP
.B \-i idle_time
Idle time in seconds for the currently named disk(s) (-a <name>) or for
all disks.
Setting this value to "0" will never spin down the disk(s).
.TP
.B \-c command_type
Api call to stop the device. Possible values are "scsi" (default value)
and "ata".
.TP
.B \-s symlink_policy
Set the policy to resolve symlinks for devices. If set to "0", symlinks
are resolve only on start. If set to "1", symlinks are also resolved on
runtime until success. By default symlinks are only resolve on start.
If the symlink doesn't resolve to a device, the default configuration
will be applied.
.TP
.B \-l logfile
Name of logfile (written only after a disk has spun up). Please note that
this option might cause the disk which holds the logfile to spin up just
because another disk had some activity. This option should not be used on
systems with more than one disk except for tuning purposes. On single-disk
systems, this option should not cause any additional spinups.
.TP
.B \-t disk
Spin-down the specified disk immediately and exit. It can be used in combination
with
.B \-c
to specify the command type.
.TP
.B \-d
Debug mode. It will print debugging info to stdout/stderr (/var/log/syslog
if started as with systemctl)
.TP
.B \-h
Print usage information.
.SH "DISK SELECTION"
The parameter
.B \-a
can be used to set a filter on the disk's device name (omit /dev/) for
subsequent idle-time settings. The default is all disks:
.P
.TP
.B \1)
A
.B \-i
option before the first
.B \-a
option will set the default idle time.
.TP
.B \2)
In order to disable spin-down of disks per default, and then re-enable
spin-down on selected disks, set the default idle time to 0.
.SH EXAMPLE
hd-idle -i 0 -a sda -i 300 -a sdb -i 1200
.P
This example sets the default idle time to 0 (meaning hd-idle will never
try to spin down a disk) and default "scsi" api command, then sets explicit
idle times for disks which have the string "sda" or "sdb" in their device name.
.SH EXAMPLE
hd-idle -i 0 -c ata -a sda -i 300 -a sdb -i 1200 -c scsi
.P
This example sets the default idle time to 0 (meaning hd-idle will never
try to spin down a disk) and default "ata" api command, then sets explicit
idle times for disks which have the string "sda" or "sdb" in their device name
and sets "sdb" to use "ata" api command.
.P
The option -c allows to set the api call that sends the spindown command.
Possible values are "scsi" (the default value) or "ata".
