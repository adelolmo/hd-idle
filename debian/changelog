hd-idle (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * The parameter "-s" allows to resolve symlinks for disk names also in runtime.
    It is disable by default, because resolving symlinks causes an overhead.
    That means that disk symlinks only get resolved on start up by default.
    If the parameter "-s" is set to 1, disk symlinks will be also resolve during
    execution until the symlink is resolved.

hd-idle (1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Monitor the skew between monitoring cycles, on discovery of clock skew
    reset the drive spin_down status to "spun up" and reset the time to current
    in order to capture potential high loading or (more likely) recovery from
    suspend or sleep

hd-idle (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * The parameter "-a" now also supports symlinks for disk names. Thus, disks
    can be specified using something like /dev/disk/by-uuid/... Use "-d" to
    verify that the resulting disk name is what you want.

    Please note that disk names are resolved to device nodes at startup. Also,
    since many entries in /dev/disk/by-xxx are actually partitions, partition
    numbers are automatically removed from the resulting device node.

  * Simply log spinup.
