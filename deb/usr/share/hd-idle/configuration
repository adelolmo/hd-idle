# hd-idle command line options
# Options are:
#  -a <name>               Set device name of disks for subsequent idle-time
#                          parameters (-i). This parameter is optional in the
#                          sense that there's a default entry for all disks
#                          which are not named otherwise by using this
#                          parameter. This can also be a symlink
#                          (e.g. /dev/disk/by-uuid/...)
#  -i <idle_time>          Idle time in seconds.
#  -c <command_type>       Api call to stop the device. Possible values are "scsi"
#                          (default value) and "ata".
#  -l <logfile>            Name of logfile (written only after a disk has spun
#                          up). Please note that this option might cause the
#                          disk which holds the logfile to spin up just because
#                          another disk had some activity. This option should
#                          not be used on systems with more than one disk
#                          except for tuning purposes. On single-disk systems,
#                          this option should not cause any additional spinups.
#
# Options not exactly useful here:
#  -t <disk>               Spin-down the specified disk immediately and exit.
#  -d                      Debug mode. It will print debugging info to
#                          stdout/stderr (/var/log/syslog if started as with systemctl)
#  -h                      Print usage information.
